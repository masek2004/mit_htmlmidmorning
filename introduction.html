<p>The Future</h3>
<p>"The future of the world is at risk"That is what every single living being in the universe is talking about or complain about.Funny thing is that they complain of their own doings!They complain of how bad the environment is but their own hearts and thoughts are worser than the situation in hand!</p>
<p>So this is to everyone, get your house in order first before commenting on our home!</p>
<pThe future though is in the hands of tech!And tech is developing and growing faster each day. Keping up with the tech takes effort,passion and drive! </p>

<h5>HIGH SCHOOL</h5>
<P>Honestly high school life <a href="https://www.emobilis.ac.ke/"target="_blank">EMOBILIS</a> sucks but at the same time its fun and confusing to those who dont take it seriously.For me it just fine made friends fake and real ones but all in all i made good choices and resulted in something that will help me in my life!But it moves fast though it seems to be dragging along but its the struggles and troubles that drag time in our minds. </P>
